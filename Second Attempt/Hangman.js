let word = prompt("Welcome to Hangman! Player 1, please enter a word for Player 2 to guess.").toUpperCase();

// note the switch toUpperCase(), we want to always work in upper case letters to avoid confusing 'a' and 'A' as unequal.

let revealedLetters = new Array(word.length); // creates an array with as many elements as word has characters. Each index of revealedLetters will correspond to a character in word, and if revealedLetters[n] is truthy, then word[n] has been correctly guessed.
revealedLetters.fill(false);

const maxStrikes = 6; 
let startingstrikes = 0; // the number of incorrect guesses made so far

let strikeLetters = new Array(maxStrikes); // this will contain every letter that has been incorrectly guessed.

drawWordProgress(); // run this now, to draw the empty word at the start of the game.

// Manipulates the DOM to write all the strike letters to the appropriate section in hangman.html
function drawStrikeLetters() {
    // your DOM manipulation code here
    // should create a String from strikeLetters and put that into the content of some element.
}

// Manipulates the DOM to write the successfully guessed letters of the word, replacing them with dashes if not yet guessed
function drawWordProgress() {
    // your DOM manipulation code here
    // should iterate over revealedLetters, and if the value at each index is truthy, print the corresponding letter from word. Otherwise, it should print a -.
}

// Manipulates the DOM to update the image of the gallows for the current game state.
function drawGallows() { 
    // your DOM manipulation code here 
    // should update an <img> element in the appropriate hangman.html section to point to "images/strike-"+strikes+".png"
}

 Next you'll need to attach an event listener to the <form> element in hangman.html. When the form is submitted, you'll need to invoke a function named "processGuess()":

function processGuess() {
    let guess =  form// the value of the <form>'s <input> element, toUpperCase()!

    if (strikes < maxStrikes) {
        // game logic goes here
    } else
        alert("The game is over!"); 
}
